This guide is focused on the immediate actions a customer should take should they experience a catastrophic site failure. In all cases, the first step should be to file an emergency downtime on-call ticket; this will immediately escalate the incident and ensure that you are able to get the best and fastest service. 

This guide does not cover all potential post-disaster recovery processes, as those will depend on the nature of the incident and the impact that it had on your site. You will have engaged with Pantheon support during the incident, and the support team will help determine what remediation steps are required.
