Working with Pantheon support during emergencies

## Support channels

* Ticketing: If your Elite site is suffering downtime on the Live environment, your first step should be to open an emergency on-call ticket. 
Chat normally has a quicker response time, but emergency on-call tickets are absolutely escalated and response times to these tickets should be comparable. 

* Slack: Diamond tier accounts can have access to a dedicated Slack channel in which customers can interact directly with their CSM, AM, and primary support resources. This is primarily intended as a means for quick communication and collaboration, and should not be used in lieu of the ticketing system, as there are no SLOs associated with Slack channels.

* Phone/teleconference: A phone call or teleconference can be requested for emergency support. This can be done either when filing the emergency ticket, or in the ticket thread once open.

Note that tickets and chat have tier-specific response time objectives, while email, phone, and Slack channels do not. See https://pantheon.io/docs/support for details.


## Escalation paths

Depending on the account tier, your escalation path may differ. Escalation paths include:

* Dedicated Customer Success Engineer: All Diamond tier accounts have a named senior support engineer, and tickets and issues are routed preferentially to them. 

* Customer Success Manager: Serves as a coordinator when support involves multiple teams, or when additional subject matter experts need to be brought into the process. The CSM is also responsible for any post-incident RCA or performance reviews.

* Account Manager: Also serves as a coordinator of support efforts.

* Managed Updates: If the issue arises from a Managed Updates deployment, the first point of escalation is the MU Engagement Manager currently involved in deploying the updates, and secondarily the Manager of the Managed Updates team.
